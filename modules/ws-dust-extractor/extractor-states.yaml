# List of globals defining the states of the dust extractor. Just a way to
# hardcode them as enums so once place can update all the usages of the states.
#
# List of states:
# - standby - Machine is in standby and ready to do stuff.
# - extracting - Machine is in extraction mode.
# - extracting-min-run - Machine is extracting but is still in it's minimum run time.
# - extracting-spindown - Extraction is turned off but the motor is spinning down.
# - cleaning - The cleaning motor is running.
# - cleaning-spindown - The cleaning motor is off but the motor is spinning down.
# - bin-full - The dust bin is full. The extractor will do nothing until this is cleared.
